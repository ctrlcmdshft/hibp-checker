## What you'll see

### Email checking
Shows you detailed breach info:
```
BREACH #1
--------------------------------------------------
Name: Adobe
Domain: adobe.com
Breach Date: 2013-10-04
Accounts Affected: 152,445,165
Data Compromised: Email addresses, Password hints, Passwords, Usernames
Verified: Yes
Description: In October 2013, 153 million Adobe accounts were breached...
```

### Password checking
Uses a secure method that doesn't send your actual password:
- Only sends first 5 characters of a hash
- Your password never leaves your computer
- Shows risk level:
  - üö® **CRITICAL**: Super common password, change it now
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH RISK**: Very commonly used
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM RISK**: Seen this before
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW RISK**: Found but not too common
  - ‚úÖ **SECURE**: Not in the database

### Paste dumps
Finds if your email appears in data dumps:
```
PASTE #1
----------------------------------------
Source: Pastebin
ID: 8VN0a4Cl
Title: Database dump
Date: 2019-03-01
Email Count: 12,345
```

### Database browsing
- **All breaches**: See recent major breaches
- **Specific lookups**: Get full details on any breach
- **Domain search**: Check what breaches hit specific websites
- **Data types**: Browse all 30+ types of data that gets stolen


## Security Notice
- **Never use your real passwords for testing or on the command line.**
- Your API key and sensitive data should be kept private. `.env` is already in `.gitignore`.

## When stuff breaks

**"API key not found"** - Check your .env file has `HIBP_API_KEY=your_key`

**"Rate limit exceeded"** - Slow down, you're making too many requests

**Network errors** - Internet connection issues, try again later

**"Invalid API key"** - Double-check you copied the key right and subscription is active

**"Unauthorized"** - API key might be expired

## Output files

Save results to JSON files like `hibp_results_20250811_143022.json`:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "check_date": "2025-08-11T14:30:22.123456",
  "breach_count": 2,
  "breaches": [
    {
      "Name": "Adobe",
      "BreachDate": "2013-10-04",
      "PwnCount": 152445165,
      "DataClasses": ["Email addresses", "Passwords"]
    }
  ]
}
```
